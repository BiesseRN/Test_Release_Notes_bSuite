**Simplification of 3D Machine Model Elements**<br>

To maximize the performance of environments containing the 3D machine model (Machine Simulation, Tooling, Machine Data), it is strongly recommended for all machines imported with a version prior to 3.0.7.125 to re-import the machine model (with due precautions).<br>
The effect of this procedure will result in a new 3D model with the same graphical quality but lightweighted from unnecessary meshes (ref. SWR 118374, sec. 2.7.27 of bSuite 3.0.7 Release Notes).
