<p><strong>Feature 197422: [bSuite][bNest] Optimization on file transfer
when importing multiple items that reference the same
file.</strong><br></p>
<p>The management of file transfer and storage for program files
(bSolid, cix, etc.) associated with imported items (from CSV, from file,
etc.) has been optimized. Now, only one file is transferred if multiple
items refer to the same file, or files are not transferred if they are
already present in the archive. This optimization can make bNest backups
more lightweight.</p>

<p><strong>Feature 197424: [bSuite] [bNest] Nesting with induced
technology</strong><br></p>
<p>A new automatic technology has been added, allowing milling to be
applied around each individual piece in the nesting pattern. This
feature is especially useful for pieces composed solely of geometries.
To activate this feature, simply go to the project parameters and select
“Single-piece milling” in the automatic technology’s milling type.</p>

<p>Among the behavioral parameters on this tab, the ones related to the
attachment point management are particularly important. They offer the
possibility to decide where to position the attachment point on the
piece (e.g., on the longest stretch, based on the detachment order of
the pieces, prioritizing linear stretches, etc.).</p>
