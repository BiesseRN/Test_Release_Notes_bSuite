<strong>Preliminary Steps</strong><br> In case a version of bSuite is
already installed on your PC, the following operations must be performed
before starting the installation procedure.
<hr>
<p><strong>Creating a Backup Copy of Data</strong></p>
<p>Create a backup of your data before proceeding with the
uninstallation of the current version of bSuite and the installation of
the setup. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to general settings</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Choose the location to save the backup.</li>
<li>Wait for the backup to complete.</li>
<li>Remember to save the default folder named “bSolid” in
documents.</li>
<li>Close bSolid.
<hr></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closing the Application and WRT</strong></p>
To avoid malfunctions, close bSuite and, if you are working on a
machine’s onboard PC, close WRT before starting the application
uninstallation. The bSuite setup detects the execution of these
processes and prompts you to close them before proceeding with
installation, uninstallation, modification, or repair.
<hr>
<p><strong>Uninstalling the Current Version of bSuite</strong></p>
<p>WARNING: If the commercial version of bSuite to be removed is older
than version 3.0.1, you must manually uninstall all the installed update
patches before uninstalling bSuite. The patches can be identified by the
name “bSuite Patch <Version>”, where <Version> is the version number to
which the patch has updated bSuite (e.g., “bSuite 3.0.1 Patch
3.18.18.0”). Starting from version 3.0.1, patches are automatically
removed by the installer. To uninstall bSuite from your PC, open
“Programs and Features” from the Windows Control Panel and select the
entry “bSolid” or “bSuite X.Y.W.Z” where X.Y.W.Z corresponds to the
commercial version (e.g., “bSuite 3.0.6.60”) from the list of
programs.</p>

<p><strong>Preliminary Operations on Some Operating Systems</strong></p>
<p>WARNING: During the installation on Windows 10, you may encounter an
anomaly related to the inability to install the .NET Framework 3.5
package. This software is a prerequisite for the application and must be
installed. To install the software on this operating system, you can use
one of the following options:</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Enable .NET Framework 3.5 from Control Panel</strong></p>
<p>The procedure described below requires an active internet
connection:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Press the Windows key <img
src="Image/Aspose.Words.36f81f01-9f70-4468-adee-9576972549f4.022.png"
alt="Image Not Found" /> on the keyboard, type “Windows Features,” and
press Enter.<br> The “Turn Windows features on or off” dialog box will
appear.<br> Alternatively, open the Control Panel, click on “Programs,”
and then click on “Turn Windows features on or off” under Programs and
Features.<br></p></li>
<li><p>Check the box for .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0),
click OK, and restart the computer if prompted.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><strong>Enable .NET Framework 3.5 from the Command Line</strong></p>
<p>You can install .NET Framework 3.5 even without an internet
connection using the following procedure:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Insert the installation CD/DVD of the operating system. If you
have an ISO image, you can mount it by right-clicking on the file and
selecting “Mount.”</p></li>
<li><p>Open the Command Prompt as Administrator and enter the following
command:<br> Dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFx3 /All
/Source:<Windows Setup Drive>/LimitAccess<br> Replace
<Windows Setup Drive> with the drive letter where the Windows
installation CD/DVD is located or where the ISO image of the operating
system is installed. For example: Dism /online /enable-feature
/featurename:NetFx3 /All /Source:D:/LimitAccess After running the
command, Windows will install .NET Framework 3.5 on your PC.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><strong>bSuite Installation</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: - Before starting the installation of bSuite, make sure that
the user account has administrator rights on the PC. - To avoid
potential conflicts with external applications, it is strictly necessary
NOT to run the installation setup from the PC desktop and/or the
“Documents” folder.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Copy the installer folder to your PC.<br> <strong>WARNING: Under
no circumstances should you copy the bSuite installer folder into one of
the destination folders (e.g., C:or C:), as having the setup in such
folders could potentially cause blocking installation
issues.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Upon starting the setup, the following window will
appear:</p></li>

<p><strong>Final Operations</strong> After installing bSuite on your PC,
perform the following operations:</p>
<p><strong>Restoring a Backup</strong> In general, if you have created a
backup copy of your data as specified in “Creating a Data Backup”
(section 5.1.1), you can restore the situation prior to bSuite
installation by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Locate the folder where the backup files were saved.</p></li>

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Check the boxes corresponding to the data you want to restore (note
that boxes corresponding to items not present in the backup archive are
disabled):</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tools</strong><br> Save the list of tools in the tool
database. In this case, tools with the same name will be
overwritten.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregates</strong><br> Save the list of aggregates in the

<li><strong>Automatic Processing Operations</strong><br> Save the list
of automatic processing operations in the automatic processing
database.</li>
<li><strong>Default Values</strong><br> Overwrite the saved processing

area.</li>
<li><strong>Edgebanding Strips</strong><br> Save the list of edgebanding
strips in the tool database. Strips with the same name will be
overwritten.</li>
<li><strong>Labels</strong><br> Save the list of labels in the tool

<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>In the “Select Machines to Restore Data” field, select the
machines to restore: the selection is highlighted by a blue frame. By
default, all machines in the backup file are already selected. To
select/deselect a machine, click on its name. To set a machine as the
default when bSuite starts, click on the star-shaped icon at the bottom
right (the star will turn yellow). To remove the machine’s default
setting, click on the star icon again (the star will turn gray). To also
restore WRT data, activate the “Restore CN Data” checkbox. This checkbox
is only present if NC data is available for the corresponding
machine.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the “Delete All Existing Machine Models” checkbox only if
you want to delete all existing machine models (e.g., those imported
from the bSuite installation) and keep only those in the backup
file.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the “Delete Existing Data and Configurations” checkbox
only if you want to delete all data during the restore phase and replace
it with the data retrieved from the backup file. Otherwise, if you want
to overwrite existing data and add new data, leave the checkbox
disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the “Restore” button.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait for the restore operation to complete, then close the dialog
and launch bSuite.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><strong>Any anomalies encountered when launching the
application</strong><br></p>
<p>When bSuite is installed, any configuration files from a previous
installation present in the user’s DocumentsSpafolder that were not
removed during the uninstallation will be modified or deleted (in the
latter case, a backup copy of the file with the .bak extension is
created) to ensure that bSuite starts with the new settings resulting
from the options selected in the installer interface.<br> If any
anomalies occur when launching the application, close bSuite and
manually delete the SuiteSetup.bSetup file in the
DocumentsSpafolder.<br> Removing the file ensures that the configuration
file will be recreated based on the user’s selections during the
installation when the application is restarted.<br> If the anomaly
persists, it is necessary to contact Biesse S.p.A. technical
support.</p>
