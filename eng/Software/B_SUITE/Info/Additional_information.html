<p><strong>Simplification of 3D Machine Model Elements</strong><br></p>
<p>To maximize the performance of environments containing the 3D machine
model (Machine Simulation, Tooling, Machine Data), it is strongly
recommended for all machines imported with a version prior to 3.0.7.125
to re-import the machine model (with due precautions).<br> The effect of
this procedure will result in a new 3D model with the same graphical
quality but lightweighted from unnecessary meshes (ref. SWR 118374,
sec.Â 2.7.27 of bSuite 3.0.7 Release Notes).</p>
